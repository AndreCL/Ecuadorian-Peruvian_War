# Ecuadorian-Peruvian War mini-mod/battle scenario
## User modification for Darkest Hour


featuring: The Awesome E3 map

### Background
While the worlds eyes are turned towards Europe, two South American nations face each other in open combat.

Saturday, July 5, 1941:
First clashes occur.
Will you use the Peruvian Agrupamiento del Norte to defeat the badly equipped and outnumbered Ecuadorian troops? Or will you fight bravely as the Ecuadorian army, managing to contain the Peruvian offensive?

July 31, 1941:
Ecuadorian President Carlos Alberto Arroyo del Río kept a sizable part of the Army in the capital, Quito, Ecuador. Will Ecuador surrender or will they take the war to the next level?

### Mod concept
The aim is to create a realistic scenario of the war, but with the possibility of ahistorical choices and outcomes.
Due to the fact that the game can't handle some of the small numbers in this war, the sizes have all been increased by a given percentage
